The {project-name} team appreciates investigative work on security vulnerabilities
carried out by well-intentioned, ethical security researchers. {short-project-name}
follows the practice of [responsible
disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) to best
protect {short-project-name}'s user base from the impact of security issues. On
{short-project-name}'s side, this means:

* {short-project-name} responds to security incidents on priority.
* {short-project-name} releases fixes for issues as soon as is practical, prioritizing by risk.
* {short-project-name} always transparently lets the community know about any incident that
  affects them.

If you have found a security vulnerability in {short-project-name}, the easiest way to
report a vulnerability is through the
https://github.com/kubewarden/community/security/advisories[Security tab on
GitHub]. This mechanism allows maintainers to communicate privately with you,
and you don't need to encrypt your messages.

Alternatively, you can disclose it responsibly by emailing
xref:mailto:cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io.adoc[cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io]
in an *unencrypted* message. Please don't discuss potential vulnerabilities in
public without validating with us first.

You can also come talk in our
https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03L52JRAFM[slack-room] on the Kubernetes
Slack server.

On receipt the security team:

* Reviews the report, verifies the vulnerability and responds with confirmation
  and/or further information requests.
* After addressing the reported security bug, {short-project-name} notifies the
  Researcher, who is then welcome to optionally disclose publicly.

Please, refer to the https://github.com/kubewarden/community[community
repository] to find more about the
project Governance and Security Policy.
