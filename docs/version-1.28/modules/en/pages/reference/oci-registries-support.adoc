You distribute your Kubewarden policies as
https://opencontainers.org[OCI Artifacts]
using regular Open Container Initiative (OCI) registries.

Kubewarden policy storage is alongside container images.
They don't require extra setup or maintenance
other than that needed for regular container images.

[NOTE]
====
You can add a registry that works with Kubewarden or
correct any registry inaccuracies by using the
"Edit this page" button at the bottom of the page

== Tools that work with OCI registries

The Kubewarden project recommends:

* https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl[`kwctl`] (our CLI tool).
* https://github.com/containers/skopeo[Skopeo] (https://github.com/containers/skopeo/pull/1705[≥ 1.9.0]).

== Known issues

=== Docker Hub

Currently, Docker Hub doesn't support OCI artifacts so can't be used to store Kubewarden policies.
Docker Inc. has announced that Docker Hub will support OCI artifacts in the
https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-hub-oci-artifacts-support/[future].

=== JFrog

Although JFrog supports OCI artifacts,
it's only partially possible to push to it, when following their specification.
