The Kubewarden stack uses webhooks to enforce policies in a Kubernetes cluster.
Each `PolicyServer` instance exposes a webhook that the Kubernetes API server
calls to validate and mutate resources. Moreover, the `kubewarden-controller`
exposes webhooks to validate and mutate the custom resources provided by the
Kubewarden project.

To decrease their attack surface, you should limit access to these webhooks to
the only valid callers they have:

* the Kubernetes API server
* the xref:/explanations/audit-scanner/audit-scanner.adoc[audit scanner]
  component.

You can do this using network policies and authentication independently, or
together, to harden the webhooks against attacks.

== Block external traffic using network policies

Webhooks are only expected to accept requests from the Kubernetes API server
and the audit scanner component. By default, however, webhooks can accept
traffic from any source. If you are using a Container Network Interface (CNI)
that supports Network Policies, you can create a policy that blocks traffic
that doesn't originate from the API server.

The built-in NetworkPolicy resource in Kubernetes can't block or admit traffic
from the cluster hosts. Also, the `kube-apiserver` process is always running on
the host network. Therefore, you must use the advanced network policy resources
from the CNI in use. Examples for Calico and Cilium follow. Consult the
documentation for your CNI for more details.

=== Calico

Use the NetworkPolicy resource in the `crd.projectcalico.org/v1` API group,
to define a network policy like the following one:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-k8s-and-audit-scanner
  namespace: kubewarden
spec:
  selector: 'app.kubernetes.io/component in {"kubewarden-controller", "policy-server"}'
  types:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        nets:
        - 192.168.42.0/24
      destination:
        selector: 'app.kubernetes.io/component in {"kubewarden-controller", "policy-server"}'
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        namespaceSelector: 'kubernetes.io/metadata.name == "kubewarden"'
      destination:
        selector: 'app.kubernetes.io/component in {"kubewarden-controller", "policy-server"}'
----

[NOTE]
====

This network policy uses label selectors introduced in Kubewarden 1.23.0. If
you are using an older version, update the labels in the policy to match your
deployment.

More sprecifically, write the

[source,yaml]
----
selector: 'app.kubernetes.io/component in {"kubewarden-controller", "policy-server"}'
----

selectors as:

[source,yaml]
----
selector: 'app.kubernetes.io/name == "kubewarden-controller" || has(kubewarden/policy-server)'
----
====

=== Cilium

Use the CiliumNetworkPolicy resource in the `cilium.io/v2` API group to define
a network policy like the following one:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-k8s-and-audit-scanner
  namespace: kubewarden
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: app.kubernetes.io/component
        operator: In
        values:
          - policy-server
          - controller
  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
      - host
      - remote-node
    - fromEndpoints:
        - matchLabels:
            k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace: kubewarden
----

[NOTE]
====

This network policy uses label selectors introduced in Kubewarden 1.23.0. If
you are using an older version, update the labels in the policy to match your
deployment.

More specifically, write the

[source,yaml]
----
matchExpressions:
  - key: app.kubernetes.io/component
    operator: In
    values:
      - policy-server
      - controller
----

expression as:

[source,yaml]
----
endpointSelector:
matchExpressions:
  - key: app.kubernetes.io/name
    operator: In
    values:
      - kubewarden-controller
  - key: kubewarden/policy-server
    operator: Exists

== Require the Kubernetes API Server to authenticate to the webhook

[TIP]
====

Refer to xref:/howtos/security-hardening/webhook-mtls.adoc[webook mTLS
how-to] for a step-by-step guide on configuring the Kubernetes API server of
K3s to authenticate to the webhook.

====

The webhooks exposed by the Kubewarden stack should only accept requests from
the Kubernetes API server or from the audit scanner component. By default,
these webhooks don't require clients to authenticate to them. They accept
any request.

You can configure the webhooks to require credentials so that only the API
server and the audit scanner processes can access them. Refer to the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#authenticate-apiservers[Kubernetes
documentation] for more information.

. Configure the API server to present a client certificate to the webhook,
pointing to an `AdmissionConfiguration` file to configure the
`ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` and `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` plug-ins:
+
Create a file named `admission.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
- name: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
 configuration:
   apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
   kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
   kubeConfigFile: "/etc/k8s/admission/kubeconfig"
- name: MutatingAdmissionWebhook
 configuration:
   apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
   kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
   kubeConfigFile: "/etc/k8s/admission/kubeconfig"
----
+
This is the same configuration file used to configure other plug-ins, such as
`PodSecurity`. If your distribution or setup uses additional admission
plug-ins, you should also configure those.

. Create the `kubeconfig` file the admission plug-ins refer to. Kubewarden only
supports client certificate authentication, so generate a TLS key pair, and
set the kubeconfig to use either client-certificate and client-key or
client-certificate-data and client-key-data.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
users:
- name: '*.kubewarden.svc'
  user:
    client-certificate: /path/to/client/cert
    client-key: /path/to/client/key
----

. Start the `kube-apiserver` binary with the flag
`--admission-control-config-file` pointing to your `AdmissionConfiguration`
file. The way to do this varies by distribution, and it isnâ€™t supported
universally, such as in hosted Kubernetes providers. Consult the
documentation for your Kubernetes distribution.

. Make the certificate of the root CA that issued the API server client
certificate available to the Kubewarden stack.
+
Put its content into a `ConfigMap` under the `kubewarden`
namespace using a key named `client-ca.crt`.
+
Assuming the root CA is available at `/etc/k8s/admission/certs/rootCA.crt`,
create the `ConfigMap` with the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
kubectl create configmap -n kubewarden api-server-mtls \
   --from-file=client-ca.crt=/etc/k8s/admission/certs/rootCA.crt
----

. Finally, when installing the `kubewarden-controller` Helm chart, make sure to
enable the following values:
+
- Set `mTLS.enable` to `true`.
- Set `mTLS.configMapName` to the name of the `ConfigMap` that was previously created.
+
The `ConfigMap` name is `api-server-mtls`, so the Helm command to
install the `kubewarden-controller` is:
+
[source,console]
----
helm install --wait -n kubewarden kubewarden-controller kubewarden/kubewarden-controller \
   --set mTLS.enable=true \
   --set mTLS.configMapName=api-server-mtls
----
+
The Kubewarden controller creates a client certificate for use by the audit
scanner component. The certificate is automatically rotated by the
controller when needed.
