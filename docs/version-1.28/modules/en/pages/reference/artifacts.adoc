== Verifying Kubewarden

There is a tutorial on xref:/tutorials/verifying-kubewarden.adoc[verifying
Kubewarden] demonstrating how to verify Kubewarden artifacts.

== Binaries

Our `kwctl` CLI tool is published via https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/releases[GitHub releases].

== OCI artifacts

For Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts, the project publishes everything
in `ghcr.io` under https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/packages.

- https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/packages/policies[`kubewarden/packages/policies/*`]
  are the policy Wasm OCI artifacts.
- https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/packages/charts[`kubewarden/packages/charts/*`]
  are the Helm charts as OCI artifacts. They follow SLSA standards.
- the container images published as OCI images: `kubewarden-controller`, `policy-server`, `audit-scanner`, `kubectl`.
- there's also `packages/tests/*` containing artifacts used in e2e tests.

== Helm charts via HTTPS

Kubewarden publishes Helm charts in the Helm chart HTTPS repository at
https://charts.kubewarden.io. They're without SLSA, or signatures, but this
type of Helm repository provides searching.
