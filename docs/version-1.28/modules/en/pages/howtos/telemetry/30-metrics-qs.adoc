This section documents how to enable metrics reporting on the Policy Server.

[NOTE]
====
Before continuing, make sure you completed the previous
xref:howtos/telemetry/10-opentelemetry-qs.adoc#_install_opentelemetry[OpenTelemetry] section of this book.
You need it for this section to work correctly.
====

You use https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] to collect metrics exposed by the Policy
Server.

== Install Prometheus

You use https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator[Prometheus Operator],
that lets us define Prometheus' targets.

There are many ways to install and set up Prometheus. For ease of deployment, you should use the
Prometheus community Helm chart.

The Prometheus Operator deployed with this Helm chart uses https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/design.md#servicemonitor[Service
Monitors],
to define which services Prometheus monitors.

In your case, you are adding a ServiceMonitor targeting the `kubewarden` namespace for services that
match labels `app=kubewarden-policy-server-default` and `app.kubernetes.io/name: kubewarden-controller`.
This configures the Prometheus Operator to inspect which Kubernetes Endpoints belong to services matching these conditions.

You can create the two ServiceMonitors named `kubewarden-controller` and `kubewarden-policy-server` for use by the
default Prometheus instance installed by the Helm chart.

To do that, you should create the following values file:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
cat <<EOF > kube-prometheus-stack-values.yaml
prometheus:
  additionalServiceMonitors:
    - name: kubewarden
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: kubewarden-policy-server-default
      namespaceSelector:
        matchNames:
          - kubewarden
      endpoints:
        - port: metrics
          interval: 10s
    - name: kubewarden-controller
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: kubewarden-controller
      namespaceSelector:
        matchNames:
          - kubewarden
      endpoints:
        - port: metrics
          interval: 10s
EOF
----

You should install the Prometheus stack Helm Chart:

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing (2023-11-17) the latest chart version is `51.5.3`
====


[subs="+attributes",console]
----
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

helm install --wait --create-namespace \
  --namespace prometheus \
  --version 51.5.3 \
  --values kube-prometheus-stack-values.yaml \
  prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
----

== Install Kubewarden

You can now install Kubewarden, in the recommended way with Helm charts.

[NOTE]
====
cert-manager is a requirement of OpenTelemetry,
but you have already installed it in a previous section of this documentation.
====


Firs , you should add the Helm repository that contains Kubewarden:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
helm repo add kubewarden https://charts.kubewarden.io
----

Then you install the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) defined by
Kubewarden:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
helm install --wait \
  --namespace kubewarden --create-namespace \
  kubewarden-crds kubewarden/kubewarden-crds
----

Now you can deploy the rest of the Kubewarden stack. The official helm
chart creates a PolicyServer named `default`.

You should configure the Helm Chart so that you have metrics enabled
in Kubewarden. The `kubewarden-values.yaml` file should have the following contents:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
telemetry:
  mode: sidecar
  metrics: True
  sidecar:
    metrics:
      port: 8080
----

Now, install the Helm charts:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
helm install --wait \
  --namespace kubewarden \
  --create-namespace \
  --values kubewarden-values.yaml \
  kubewarden-controller kubewarden/kubewarden-controller

helm install --wait \
  --namespace kubewarden \
  --create-namespace \
  kubewarden-defaults kubewarden/kubewarden-defaults \
  --set recommendedPolicies.enabled=True \
  --set recommendedPolicies.defaultPolicyMode=monitor
----

This creates the `default` instance of `PolicyServer`:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
kubectl get policyservers.policies.kubewarden.io
NAME      AGE
default   3m7s
----

By default, this policy server doesn't have metrics enabled.

== Accessing Prometheus

Prometheus exposes a UI that you can use to inspect metrics exposed by different
components within your Kubernetes cluster.

You can forward the Prometheus port so you can access it.

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
kubectl port-forward -n prometheus --address 0.0.0.0 svc/prometheus-operated 9090
----

Now, you can visit Prometheus on port `9090` and perform a query, for example:
`kubewarden_policy_evaluations_total`. You can see that the number of evaluations grows over
time as more requests go through the policy.

== Accessing Grafana

You can forward the Grafana service so you can access it.

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
kubectl port-forward -n prometheus --address 0.0.0.0 svc/prometheus-grafana 8080:80
----

You can now login with the default username `admin` and password `prom-operator`.

=== Using the Kubewarden Grafana dashboard

Kubewarden has Grafana dashboard with basic metrics
giving an overview about how Kubewarden behaves in the cluster. This dashboard
is available in the GitHub releases of the Kubewarden policy-server repository as a
https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-server/releases/latest/download/kubewarden-dashboard.json[JSON file]
or at the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15314[Grafana website].

To import the dashboard into your environment, you can download the JSON file
from the Grafana website or the repository:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
curl https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-server/releases/latest/download/kubewarden-dashboard.json
----

Once you have the file you should access the Grafana dashboard and
https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/#import-dashboard[import it].
Visit `/dashboard/import` in the Grafana dashboard and follow these steps:

. Copy and paste the JSON file contents into the `Import via panel json` box in the Grafana UI.
. Click the `Load` button.
. Choose `Prometheus` as the source.
. Click the `Import` button.

Another option is import it directly from the grafana.com website. For this:

. Copy the dashboard ID from the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15314[dashboard page],
. Paste it into the `Import via grafana.com` field
. Click the `load` button.
. After importing the dashboard, define the Prometheus data source to use and finish
the import process.

The Grafana dashboard has panes showing the state of all
policies managed by Kubewarden. It also has policy-specific panels.

You can obtain detailed metrics for a specific policy by changing the value of
the `policy_name` variable to match the required policy's name.

You should be able to see a dashboard similar to this:
