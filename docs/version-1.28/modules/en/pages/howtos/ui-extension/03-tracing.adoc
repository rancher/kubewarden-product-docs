Tracing allows collection of fine-grained details about policy evaluations.
It's a useful tool for debugging issues in your Kubewarden deployment and policies.

https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] is used to receive, store, and visualize trace events.

== Prerequisites

Cert-Manager and OpenTelemetry are required.
Follow
xref:howtos/telemetry/10-opentelemetry-qs.adoc#_install_opentelemetry[these instructions]
to install Cert Manager and the OpenTelemetry Operator.

== Install Jaeger

Apply the installation steps from the
xref:howtos/telemetry/20-tracing-qs.adoc#_install_jaeger[tracing quickstart].

Once all the resources are created by the Jaeger operator,
there is a Service under
`my-open-telemetry-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local`.

The Jaeger Query UI is reachable at the following address:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
https://<CLUSTER_IP>/api/v1/namespaces/jaeger/services/http:my-open-telemetry-query:16686/proxy/search
----

This endpoint may be unique depending on your configuration.
You can find the endpoint listed for your Jaeger resource under the Services page.

=== Update `rancher-kubewarden-controller` with Jaeger endpoint

You'll need to edit the `rancher-kubewarden-controller` resource to add the Jaeger endpoint "my-open-telemetry-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:4317".

For instance:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
telemetry:
  tracing:
    enabled: True
    jaeger:
      endpoint: "my-open-telemetry-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:4317"
      tls:
        insecure: true
----

`my-open-telemetry-collector` is the service we installed under the `jaeger` namespace.

[CAUTION]
====
For simplicity,
we're not encrypting the communication between the OpenTelemetry collector and the Jaeger endpoint.

This is *not suitable for production deployment*.
We recommend you read Jaeger's
https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/kubernetes/[documentation].
====


You should now be able to view any failed requests for policies tied to a specific Policy Server,
or the detail view for any given policy.
You can get a more in-depth view of the traces by using the Jaeger UI.
