[TIP]
====
Before working with Policy Groups, consult the
xref:explanations/policy-groups.adoc[explanation].
====


Using the example from the xref:../explanations/policy-groups.adoc[explanation of Policy Groups],
use these commands to implement it.

[,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f group-policy-demo.yaml
----

.A `ClusterAdmissionPolicyGroup` that rejects Pods that use images with the `latest` tag, unless the images are signed by two trusted parties: Alice and Bob.

Once the policy is active, the creation of a non-compliant Pod will be rejected.
To obtain more information about the evaluation of the policies that are part of the
group, increase the verbosity level of `kubectl`:

[NOTE]
====
The evaluation output produced by the policies that are part of the group is visible
only by increasing the verbosity level of `kubectl`.

A verbosity level of `4` is enough to see the evaluation output of the policies.
