This section details a real-world deployment of Kubewarden in a demanding, large-scale environment. It illustrates how to configure Kubewarden for high availability and performance and what to expect under heavy load.

== Environment Overview

The infrastructure consists of approximately 20 Kubernetes clusters. The largest of these clusters are characterized by significant size and resource volume:

* Nodes: ~400
* Namespaces: ~4,000
* Managed Resources:
** Pods: 10,000
** RoleBindings: 13,000
** Ingresses: 12,000
** Deployments: 8,000
** Services: 13,000

== Kubewarden Configuration

To meet the demands of this environment, Kubewarden is configured with a focus on workload isolation and high availability.

* Policy Enforcement: 22 `ClusterAdmissionPolicies` are enforced across the clusters, with no namespace-specific `AdmissionPolicies`.
* PolicyServer Architecture: Two separate `PolicyServer` deployments are used to isolate workloads:
** One `PolicyServer` is dedicated exclusively to context-aware policies.
** A second `PolicyServer` handles all other, non-context-aware policies.
* Scalability and Resources:
** Replicas: Each `PolicyServer` deployment runs 15 replicas to handle the high volume of requests.
** Resource Allocation: Each replica is allocated 300 MB of memory and 4 CPU cores.

== Performance Metrics

This configuration successfully manages a high rate of admission requests while maintaining predictable performance.

* Admission Request Throughput: The clusters handle up to 300 admission requests per second (including both webhook validations and audit scans).
* Policy Latency:
** Typical Latency: Context-aware policies generally take around 500ms to execute.
** Timeouts: In this high-throughput environment, webhook timeouts are configured at 2.5 seconds, while the `PolicyServer` timeout is set to 10 seconds. While most requests are fast, the infrastructure is built to handle occasional slow operations without compromising the API server's stability.

== Audit Scanner Performance

The audit-scanner is utilized to ensure continuous compliance across the vast number of resources.

* Frequency: A cluster-wide audit is performed every 4 hours.
* Configuration: The audit job is tuned for maximum parallelism to reduce runtime:

--parallel-namespaces: "10"
--parallel-resources: "20"

--page-size: "1000"

* Audit Duration: Even on the largest cluster with tens of thousands of resources, a full audit job completes in
