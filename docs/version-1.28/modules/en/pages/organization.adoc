{project-name} organizes project documentation as follows:

* xref:/introduction.adoc[Introduction]
* xref:/quick-start.adoc[Quick start]
* _Tutorials_—learning through examples.
* _Explanations_—underlying concepts.
* _Howtos_—getting {short-project-name} tasks done.
* _Reference_
* Organization—this page
* xref:/personas.adoc[Personas]—who is {short-project-name} for?
* xref:/disclosure.adoc[Security]
* xref:/glossary.adoc[Glossary]

Most of the material is in the four sections, _Tutorials_, _Explanations_, _Howtos_, and _Reference_. There may be overlap as the sections are not mutually exclusive. The {short-project-name} project tries to follow the link:https://diataxis.fr/[Diátaxis] documentation framework.
