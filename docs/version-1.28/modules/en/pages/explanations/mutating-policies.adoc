Mutating policies receive an object request and rebuild it (mutate it) into a
new request. This is according to the defined values in the settings of the
policy. The request proceeds through the Kubernetes API, potentially being
evaluated by other policies.

To permit mutating request behavior, set the `ClusterAdmissionPolicy.mutating`
field to `true`.

However, if you set the `ClusterAdmissionPolicy.mutating` field to `false`,
the mutated requests will be rejected.

== Why mutating policies can be dangerous

=== Unreviewed mutating policies can introduce vulnerabilities

[WARNING]
====

To prevent system abuse Kubewarden administrators should review mutating
policies. Mutating policies could, for example, modify a workload, such that it
permits privileged container creation.

====


==== Solution

If in doubt, split policies into mutating and validating policies, instead of
writing or deploying policies that both validate and mutate. This is particularly
important when using a DSL (such as Rego) to build complex policies.

=== Misconfigured mutating policies together with 3rd party Kubernetes Controllers can get stuck in an infinite loop

[WARNING]
====

Mutating policies return requests that proceed through the Kubernetes API. If
there are other Kubernetes Controllers that listen for those same resources,
they may mutate them back in a follow-up request. This could lead to an
infinite feedback loop of mutations.

====


==== Solution

Perform the mutation against:

. The lower type of resource (e.g: Pod).
. The highest type of resource (e.g: Deployment). Note: this could still lead
  to loops if a controller is managing those resources. For example,
  controllers of GitOps solutions (like fleet, flux, argo, ...) or other third
  party controllers that translate their own CRDs into Deployment objects.

== Examples

You can see a mutating policy at work. Create the following
`ClusterAdmissionPolicy` with the `mutating` field set to `true`:

[subs="+attributes",bash]
----
# Command
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: psp-user-group
spec:
  module: "registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/user-group-psp:v0.1.5"
  rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["pods"]
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
  mutating: true
  settings:
    run_as_user:
      rule: "MustRunAs"
      ranges:
        - min: 1000
          max: 2000
        - min: 3000
          max: 4000
    run_as_group:
      rule: "RunAsAny"
    supplemental_groups:
      rule: "RunAsAny"
EOF

# Output
clusteradmissionpolicy.policies.kubewarden.io/psp-user-group created
----

You use the
https://github.com/kubewarden/user-group-psp-policy[`psp-user-group`] policy to
control users and groups in containers and can mutate the requests. In the
previous example, you set the `runAsUser` field and it's added to the
container `securityContext` section.

As the `mutating` field is `true`, the following request succeeds:

[subs="+attributes",bash]
----
# Command
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pause-user-group
spec:
  containers:
    - name: pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause
EOF

# Output
pod/pause-user-group created
----

You can see the results of the container's `securityContext`:

[subs="+attributes",bash]
----
# Command
kubectl get pods pause-user-group -o jsonpath='{ .spec.containers[].securityContext }'

# Output
{"runAsUser":1000}
----

Now, modify the `ClusterAdmissionPolicy` by setting the field `mutating` to `false`:

[subs="+attributes",bash]
----
# Command
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: psp-user-group
spec:
  module: "registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/user-group-psp:v0.1.5"
  rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["pods"]
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
  mutating: false
  settings:
    run_as_user:
      rule: "MustRunAs"
      ranges:
        - min: 1000
          max: 2000
        - min: 3000
          max: 4000
    run_as_group:
      rule: "RunAsAny"
    supplemental_groups:
      rule: "RunAsAny"
EOF

# Output
clusteradmissionpolicy.policies.kubewarden.io/psp-user-group configured
----

As the `mutating` field is `false`, the following request fail:

[subs="+attributes",bash]
----
# Command
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pause-user-group
spec:
  containers:
    - name: pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause
EOF

# Output
Error from server: error when creating ".\\pause-user-group.yaml": admission webhook "psp-user-group.kubewarden.admission" denied the request: Request rejected by policy psp-user-group. The policy attempted to mutate the request, but it is currently configured to not allow mutations.
----

In conclusion, you can see Kubewarden replicates the same behavior as the
deprecated Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSP).
