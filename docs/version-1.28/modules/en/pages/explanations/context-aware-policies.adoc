Developers can create policies that fetch information from a Kubernetes cluster
at run time. These are context aware policies. Context aware policies can
determine whether an `AdmissionRequest` is acceptable using information from
resources deployed in the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Context aware policies are only available in Kubewarden versions â‰¥ v1.6.0.
====

Control of which resources a policy can access in the cluster is by by the
policy server's
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/[Service
Account]. A cluster administrator controls what a policy can access via
Kubernetes RBAC rules. Context aware policies have only *read* access to the
requested resources.

For security reasons, only `ClusterAdmissionPolicy` policies can fetch
information from the Kubernetes cluster. This is because unprivileged users can
deploy `AdmissionPolicy` resources.

If an unprivileged user deploys a context aware policy as an
`AdmissionPolicy`, the system:

- Blocks all attempts to access Kubernetes resources.
- Reports them to the cluster administrator.

By default, Kubewarden blocks all cluster resources. A Kubewarden administrator
defines which Kubernetes resources each context aware policy can read.
`contextAwareResources` to do this.

The following example deploys a policy that requires access to the `Deployment`
and `Pod` resources:

[subs="+attributes",yaml]
----
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: context-aware-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  policyServer: default
  module: "registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/context-aware-policy:v1.0.0"
  settings: {}
  contextAwareResources:
    - apiVersion: "apps/v1"
      kind: "deployment"
    - apiVersion: "v1"
      kind: "pod"
  rules:
    - apiGroups: ["apps"]
      apiVersions: ["v1"]
      resources: ["deployment"]
      operations:
        - CREATE
        - UPDATE
  mutating: false
----

Once deployed, this policy can read the data of the `deployment` and `pod` resources.

Policy authors provide lists of Kubernetes resources for their context aware
policy. Policy authors do this by annotating the policy. Kubewarden
administrators view policy metadata using the `kwctl inspect` command. They can
get a list of resources the policy needs access to. An administrator uses this
list to populate the `ClusterAdmissionPolicy` definition.

[WARNING]
====

To prevent system abuse, Kubewarden administrators must review the resources
the policy accesses.

For example, a policy evaluating ingress objects would have good reasons to
read the `Ingress` resources defined in the cluster. The same policy can't
justify having access to `Secret` resources.

Policies should have the minimum access needed to function correctly.

====


[NOTE]
====

Kubernetes resource identification uses `apiVersion` and `kind`.

Usually, `apiVersion` is a string in the format `<api>/<version>`. Resources
from the `core` API group (Pod, Service, and others) shouldn't define the group
name, `<api>`. They should only define the `<version>` (for example, `v1`).

For a core resource, the first won't work, the second will.

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
- apiVersion: "core/v1"
  kind: "pod"
----

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
- apiVersion: "v1"
  kind: "pod"
----

All other Kubernetes resources need the full definition: `<api>/<version>`.
