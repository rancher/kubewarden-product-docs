{project-name} is a Kubernetes Policy Engine.
It aims to be the Universal Policy Engine for Kubernetes.

{intro-paragraph}

== How does {project-name} help?

{short-project-name} offers flexibility for policy admission and enforcement in
a Kubernetes environment.

=== Benefits and value

- Use any programming language that generates https://webassembly.org[WebAssembly] binaries to write your policies.
- WebAssembly enables policy compatibility across processors and operating systems.
- Reuse of policies from other policy engines without the need for rewriting them.
- Distribute policies using standard and secure mechanisms such as https://opencontainers.org[OCI] compliant registries.
- Policy enforcement at admission ensures only compliant workloads run.
- The {short-project-name} audit scanner actively and continuously checks policy enforcement over time.
- Verify policies using https://slsa.dev[SLSA] (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) tools and practices.
- {project-name} provides a comprehensive approach to admission policy management.
- CNCF membership and a growing open source community and ecosystem help {short-project-name} with transparency, collaboration and improvement.

=== Use cases

- Security hardening. For example, enforce policies restricting container
  privileges, enforce network policies, or block insecure image registries.
- Compliance auditing. Ensure workloads comply with organizational or
  regulatory standards and best practices.
- Resource optimization. Enforce resource limits and quotas.

There is further documentation of use cases on the xref:use-cases.adoc[use
cases] page.

== New to {short-project-name}?

If new to the {short-project-name} project start with the xref:quick-start.adoc[Quick
start guide] and the xref:explanations/architecture.adoc[architecture] page.
Then it depends where your interests take you. For policy developers there are
language specific sections in the tutorials. For integrators and administrators
there is a 'howtos' section. The explanations section contains useful
background material. There is also a xref:glossary.adoc[glossary].

== What is WebAssembly?

As stated on https://webassembly.org/[WebAssembly's official website]:

____
WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a
stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable
compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on
the web for client and server applications.
____

Wasm was originally conceived as a browser "extension". However, the
WebAssembly community is engaged in efforts to allow the execution of Wasm code
outside browsers.

== Why use WebAssembly?

Users can write Kubernetes policies using their
favorite programming language, provided its toolchain can generate
Wasm binaries.

Wasm modules are portable, once built they can run on any kind of processor
architecture and operating system. For example, a policy developed and built on
Apple Silicon can run on AMD64/Intel64 Linux without conversion.

Policy authors can reuse their skills, tools and best practices. Policies are
"traditional" programs that can have reusable blocks (regular libraries). You
can lint and test them and you can plug them into current CI and CD workflows.

== Policy distribution

You can serve {short-project-name} policies using a standard web server or, better,
you can publish them in an OCI compliant registry as
https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts[OCI artifacts].

neutral] project as defined by the CNCF.
