[NOTE]
====
Gatekeeper support starts from these releases:

* kwctl: v0.2.0
* policy-server: v0.2.0
====


Gatekeeper is a project targeting Kubernetes with out-of-the-box features for integration.

== Compatibility with existing policies

All existing Gatekeeper policies should be compatible with Kubewarden as explained in this chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you find this not to be true, for your Gatekeeper policies,
report it,
and we'll work to ensure your Gatekeeper policy runs with Kubewarden.
====


Policies need compilation with the `opa` CLI to `wasm` target.

For policy execution, you can read more about the Open Policy Agent
xref:tutorials/writing-policies/rego/02-builtin-support.adoc[built-in support] in Kubewarden.
