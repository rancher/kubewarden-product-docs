[NOTE]
====
Open Policy Agent support has been introduced starting from these releases:

* kwctl: v0.2.0
* policy-server: v0.2.0
====


Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general purpose policy framework that uses the
Rego language to write policies.

== Introduction

Rego policies work by receiving an input to evaluate,
and produce an output as a response.
In this sense, OPA has no specific tooling for targeting writing policies for Kubernetes.

Specifically, policies in OPA receive a JSON input and produce a JSON output.
The OPA server is configured to receive admission review requests from Kubernetes.
The policies receive a Kubernetes `AdmissionReview` object in JSON format.
They have to return a valid `AdmissionReview` object as the evaluation results.

== Compatibility with existing policies

All policies can be compiled to the `wasm` target (WebAssembly) with the official `opa` CLI tool.

In terms of policy execution,
you can read more about the xref:tutorials/writing-policies/rego/02-builtin-support.adoc[OPA built-in support] implemented in Kubewarden.
