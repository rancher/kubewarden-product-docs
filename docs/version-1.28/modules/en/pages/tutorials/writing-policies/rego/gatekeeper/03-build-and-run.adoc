You can build and run the policy in exactly the same way as a Rego policy targeting Open Policy Agent.
The structure of your project is:

----
.
├── data
│   ├── default-ns.json
│   └── other-ns.json
└── policy.rego

1 directory, 3 files
----

== Build

Build the policy by running the `opa` command:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
$ opa build -t wasm -e policy/violation policy.rego
----

This builds the rego policy, with:

* `target`: `wasm`. We want to build the policy for the `wasm` target.
* `entrypoint`: `policy/violation`. The entry point is the `violation`
rule inside the `policy` package.
* `policy.rego`: build and include the `policy.rego` file.

The earlier command generates a `bundle.tar.gz` file.
You can extract the Wasm module from it:

[subs="+attributes",shell]
----
$ tar -xf bundle.tar.gz /policy.wasm
----

The project tree looks like the following:

----
.
├── bundle.tar.gz
├── data
│   ├── default-ns.json
│   └── other-ns.json
├── policy.rego
└── policy.wasm

1 directory, 5 files
----

You can now execute your policy.

== Run

Use `kwctl` to run your policy as follows:

 $ kwctl run -e gatekeeper --request-path data/other-ns.json policy.wasm | jq
 {
   "uid": "1299d386-525b-4032-98ae-1949f69f9cfc",
   "allowed": true
 }

This is your resource created in the namespace called `other`, it's accepted, as expected.

Now you can run a request that is rejected by the policy:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
$ kwctl run -e gatekeeper --request-path data/default-ns.json policy.wasm | jq
{
  "uid": "1299d386-525b-4032-98ae-1949f69f9cfc",
  "allowed": false,
  "status": {
    "message": "it is forbidden to use the default namespace"
  }
}
----

You can see your Gatekeeper policy rejected this resource.
