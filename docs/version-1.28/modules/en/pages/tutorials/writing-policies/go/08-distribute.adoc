It's been a lengthy, and hopefully enjoyable, wander through the Go tutorial,
congratulations for having made it this far ðŸŽ‰.

During this tutorial you've recreated the
https://github.com/kubewarden/safe-labels-policy[safe-labels-policy].

There's nothing special to do when it comes to distributing a policy.
If you followed this guide, you have already published your policy using the
GitHub `release.yml` Action defined in the last chapter.

The topic of distributing policies is covered in greater depth in the
xref:../../../explanations/distributing-policies.adoc["distributing policies"]
section of Kubewarden's documentation.
