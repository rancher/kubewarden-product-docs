The https://cel.dev[Common Expression Language (CEL)] is a general-purpose
expression language designed to be fast, portable, and safe to execute. CEL as
a language is memory-safe, side-effect free, terminating (programs cannot loop
forever), and strong & dynamically typed. You can learn more about CEL at
https://cel.dev[cel.dev], and practice it in the https://playcel.undistro.io[CEL
playground].

== CEL in Kubernetes

CEL was chosen as the language for Kubernetes validation rules as CEL
expressions can be easily inlined into CRD schemas, and compiled and type-checked
"ahead-of-time" (when CRDs are created and updated). For these reasons
and its general characteristics, it's a perfect candidate for extending the
Kubernetes API.

Marked as stable with Kubernetes 1.30, one can use CEL on
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy[ValidatingAdmissionPolicies]
and other validation rules. For more info, see the Kubernetes docs
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel[here].

=== Kubernetes function libraries

Kubernetes CEL validation rules have access to several function libraries:

* https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/v0.7.0/doc/langdef.md#list-of-standard-definitions[CEL standard functions]
* https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/v0.7.0/doc/langdef.md#macros[CEL standard macros]
* https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/ext#Strings[CEL extended string function library]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#kubernetes-cel-libraries[Kubernetes CEL extension libraries],
with supplemental functions for lists, regex, URLs, authorizers, quantities,
optional types, numerical comparisons, etc.

== CEL in Kubewarden: `cel-policy`

Kubewarden provides https://github.com/kubewarden/cel-policy[cel-policy].
This is a policy that builds and bundles the upstream
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go[cel-go] interpreter, and also the
different libraries listed above and available for CEL in Kubernetes from
`apiextensions-apiserver`.

In addition, `cel-policy` bundles a *Kubewarden CEL extension library* that exposes
Kubewarden's https://github.com/kubewarden/cel-policy?tab=readme-ov-file#host-capabilities[host capabilities as native
CEL]:

* Sigstore verification
* OCI interaction
* Cryptographic functions
* Network operations
* Access to Kubernetes resources

This means that `cel-policy` is a superset of Kubernetes CEL,
and backwards-compatible. One can reuse CEL written for vanilla Kubernetes, and/or
make use of the features added by Kubewarden.

The `cel-policy` is shipped compiled and behaves as a CEL interpreter. Users of
the policy pass the desired CEL expressions in the `spec.settings` of the
(Cluster)AdmissionPolicy, and thanks to CEL features, the expression gets
compiled and typed-checked for correctness when creating or updating the
(Cluster)AdmissionPolicy. This means there's no need for custom builds of the
`cel-policy`.

=== Benefits of Kubewarden's `cel-policy` in comparison with ValidatingAdmissionPolicies

The Kubewarden `cel-policy`:

* It's CEL code is backwards-compatible with ValidatingAdmissionPolicies.
* Contrary to ValidatingAdmissionPolicies, it doesn't need a binding such as
ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding, as this is included in Kubewarden's
(Cluster)Admissionpolicies definitions.
* Can be deployed to clusters that lack ValidatingAdmissionPolicies support.
* Is context-aware, and makes use of Kubewarden's fine-grained permissions
for xref:../../../reference/spec/05-context-aware-policies.adoc[context awareness].
* Is deployed as (Cluster)AdmissionPolicy.
* Benefits from Kubewarden's tracing and telemetry on policies.
* It will be taken into account by the Audit Scanner.
* Can be developed and tested out-of-cluster thanks to kwctl.
